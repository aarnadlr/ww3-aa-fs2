WEBPACK NOTES:

1.
WHEN YOU ARE BUILDING IN DEV MODE, YOU MUST DO TO TASKS IN TERMINAL:

    a.
    WEBPACK: COMPILE ALL THE JS INTO A (Quick) WEBPACK **DEV** BUNDLE:
    $    `npm run dev`   -->    OUTPUTS:  app/assets/js/bundle.js   (non-minified)

    b.
    GULP:
    $    `gulp`          -->   Spins up a BROWSERSYNC SERVER for preview



2.
WHEN YOU ARE READY TO PUSH TO WEB, YOU MUST CREATE WEBPACK **PRODUCTION** BUNDLE:
$    `npm run build`    -->    OUTPUTS:  app/assets/js/bundle.js   (same, but minified and tree-shaking, etc)
